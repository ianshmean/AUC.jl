    auc(y_true, y_score)

This function returns the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic
curve (ROC). This function takes two vectors, `y_true` and `y_score`. The vector `y_true` is the
observed `y` in a binary classification problem. And the vector `y_score` is the real-valued
prediction for each observation.
